## Experiments in Self Hosting

I've managed to land myself a bit of a two-birds situation here; it allows me to use services under my own control and it gives me a chance to find out a bit more about how [Docker](https://www.docker.com) works (which I've been kind of curious about but haven't ever really had a chance to use before). Given this is a single-user setup, I'm using a DigitalOcean droplet with 2 GiB RAM, 1 vCPU and 50 GiB of storage for hosting and it runs pretty wellâ€”at least for now. We'll see how it goes as I add more stuff.

Because this is all very much a learning exercise for me, so I'm happy to take suggestions for optimizations, best practices, etc.
